2. Privacy Policy

All personal information we collect through the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy. Please let us know if you have any questions about our practices concerning the collection and processing of your personal information.

3. Children

In accordance with the policies of Meta® and Valve® for virtual reality games, the Game is not designed for Children, and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect, use, store, disclose, or otherwise process any personal information about Children. If you become aware that a Child disclosed personal information to us, please contact us by completing a support ticket at
https://support.gorillatagvr.com/
or emailing us at
support@anotheraxiom.com
so we may remove their personal information. User age may be collected by Meta® and Valve® in accordance with their policies. We do not collect information about the age of our users, however, if we are notified that you are a Child, your account will be banned. A “Child” is a person under the age needed to consent to the processing of Personal Information in their country of residence. 

4. Account Requirements

If you want to use the Game, you must be the minimum age required by Meta® or Valve®, as applicable, for virtual reality games (e.g., 13 years of age in the United States) and must have a valid Steam or Meta account, as applicable (collectively, “Accounts,” and each, an “Account”). We do not administer Accounts, rather, they are administered by Meta® or Valve®, as applicable. You are responsible for all activities that occur under any Account associated with you, whether or not you know about them. You must not permit a Child to access or use your Account. We will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else’s authorized or unauthorized access to your Account. You may be liable, however, for losses incurred by Another Axiom or third parties due to someone else’s use of your Account. Later versions of the Game may require that you establish a different account with us, and additional terms and restrictions will then apply.

9. Health and Safety Precautions

While you are using the Game, please be aware of your surroundings, and play and communicate safely.

The below should be reviewed before use of the Game. Failing to review the below health and safety precautions may cause damage to property, injury, or death. These health and safety precautions are not intended to be an exhaustive list, and use of the Game may involve other health and safety risks not contained below. Another Axiom is not liable for any damage to property, injury, or death that may occur as the result of your failure to review the health and safety precautions or as a result of the interactions between you or your family members and people or objects in or around the play area during your use of the Game.

Epileptic Seizure Warning. Please note that certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns, even if they have never experienced epileptic symptoms or been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images on screens, including virtual reality headsets, or playing certain video games, including the Game. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing the Game. Stop playing the Game and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision, involuntary movements, or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health complications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as a result of your use of the Game. To reduce the likelihood of a seizure or epileptic symptoms do not play the Game when tired or need sleep, and take 10- or 15-minute breaks every 30 minutes while playing the Game.
Motion Sickness. Playing video games (especially virtual reality games), including the Game, may cause motion sickness in some users. If you feel dizzy or nauseous when playing the Game, stop playing and rest. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other demanding or strenuous activities until you feel better. To limit the risk of motion sickness while playing the Game, do not use the Game when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are hung-over, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, earaches, or other health issues which may increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.
Repetitive Motion Injuries and Eyestrain. Playing video games, including the Game, can make your muscles, joints, skin, or eyes hurt. To avoid problems such as tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, skin irritation, or eyestrain: avoid excessive play; take a 10- to 15-minute break every 30 minutes while playing the Game; if your hands, wrists, arms, eyes, or other parts of your body become tired or sore while playing, or if you feel symptoms such as tingling, numbness, burning, or stiffness, stop and rest for several hours before playing again; and if you continue to have any of the above symptoms or other discomfort during or after playing the Game, stop playing and consult a doctor.
Play Area Precautions. Give yourself plenty of room to play the Game. Always be aware of your surroundings when playing the Game. While playing the Game in virtual reality you will be moving around the play area and using your hands to control gameplay. Make sure the play area is clear of furniture, objects, and other people that could be bumped into during gameplay. Please ensure that you are not near other people, stairs, balconies, windows, walls, furniture, or other objects that may pose a danger to you or could be damaged or injured during or immediately after using the Game. All objects that may pose tripping hazards, could cause injury, or could be damaged as the result of your contact with them while playing the Game should be removed from the play area prior to you playing the Game. A minimum six-feet-by-six-feet unobstructed play area is recommended for safe enjoyment of the Game. Never handle sharp or dangerous objects while playing the Game. Due to the immersive nature of the Game, sound volumes should be kept at low enough levels so that you are able to maintain awareness of your surroundings while playing the Game and so as not to damage your hearing. You should not use the Game if your awareness of your surroundings is impaired by lack of sleep, drugs, alcohol, the effects of a hangover, stress, anxiety, or when suffering from a cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or other illnesses.
10. Limited License to Broadcast Gameplay

Another Axiom believes that the Game is best served by an active and excited community of users. To encourage community growth and development, we hereby grant each valid user of the Game (“Broadcasting User”) a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited license to broadcast such Broadcasting User’s unique gameplay (“Broadcasted Content”), but only through third party media that is, at the time of broadcast, currently approved by Another Axiom (“Approved Broadcaster(s)”). In furtherance of your exercise of the foregoing limited license, you may assume that other users who participate in gameplay with you have given you non-exclusive performance rights for their parts in your Broadcasted Content, unless or until you have notice that they opt out in accordance with the provisions outlined below. To the extent a user opts out, our license with respect to Broadcasted Content, including that user, is revoked.

The above limited license is subject to the additional conditions:

a Broadcasting User may only broadcast their own gameplay;

Another Axiom may revoke a Broadcasting User’s license to broadcast for any or no reason and without notice.
Any user may revoke their permission to be included in Broadcasted Content by providing written notice to the applicable Broadcasting User of their decision to opt out (“Opt-Out Notice”). Without any obligation to do so, Another Axiom may also provide Opt-Out Notices, on a case-by-case basis, on behalf of users. Upon receipt of an Opt-Out Notice, the Broadcasting User must promptly remove the Broadcasted Content or otherwise modify the Broadcasted Content to remove the user who opted out. Another Axiom does not assume any responsibility for ensuring compliance with the foregoing.

Below is an exclusive list of currently Approved Broadcasters. Users may only use Broadcasted Content through currently Approved Broadcasters.
